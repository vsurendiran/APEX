AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) is a technique used in web development to create dynamic and interactive web applications. 
It allows web pages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging small amounts of data with the server behind the scenes. 
This means that parts of a web page can be updated without reloading the entire page, providing a smoother and more 
responsive user experience.

go to Process -> right click and create process
name=> "create appointment"
plsql code => write the json object and Array variable to store the list of errors. 

go to dynamic action -> create dynamic action 
       Button => Submit
       action => execute java script
        Code => apex.server.process ("create appointment")
                { Pageitem:{   }
}

Benefits of AJAX
==================
Improved User Experience:

AJAX enables a more dynamic and responsive user interface, reducing page reloads and providing instant feedback to the user.
Reduced Server Load:

By sending only the necessary data instead of reloading the entire page, AJAX can reduce server load and bandwidth usage.
Seamless Interactivity:

AJAX allows for seamless interactivity, enabling features like real-time form validation, auto-suggest search boxes, 
and dynamic content loading.

Challenges of AJAX
====================
Browser Compatibility:

Different browsers may handle AJAX requests slightly differently, requiring careful handling of cross-browser compatibility issues.
Complexity:

Implementing AJAX can add complexity to the application, requiring additional JavaScript and server-side handling.
SEO Considerations:

AJAX content is not always easily indexed by search engines, which can impact search engine optimization (SEO).
Despite these challenges, AJAX remains a powerful tool for creating dynamic, responsive web applications.
